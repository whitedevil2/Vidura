    " *During parliament session, each Department receives number of Parliament Questions on varied topics raised by MPs and handled in a very time bound manner on top priority. Each reply is generally prepared by seeking inputs from all the other relevant departments which requires lot of efforts and is also time consuming. It is desired a platform can be designed which can provide responses to similar PQ asked earlier, suggest probable reply and indicate different departments having similar programs and information. This will be helpful in preparing proper reply to PQ. As of now there are some search tools, separate for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. But a unified, fast and effective mechanism is missing.*"

The Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1995 .(DPCO` 95) was promulgated by the Govt. India on 6th January; 1995 in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act 1955. As per the criteria specified in para 22.7.2 of the `Modifications in Drug Policy,1986, 76 bulk drugs (subsequently reduced to 74) are included in the First Schedule of DPCO` 95. These bulk drugs are called Scheduled bulk drugs. The prices of these 74 bulk drugs, and the formulations containing any of these Scheduled drugs are controlled by the Government/ National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) as per the provisions of DPCO, 1995. No one can sell any Scheduled drug/formulation at a price higher than the price fixed by NPPA.

Most of these items are free and therefore, no licence is required. However, for few Chemicals which are under Restricted List the cases are decided by Export Facilitation Committee which comprises of representatives of various Departments. The prices of scheduled formulations are fixed by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). The NPPA consists of officials of NPPA, Ministry of Finance and Drugs Controller General (India). (c) & (d): There are 74 bulk drugs specified in the First Schedule of DPCO, 1995. As per provisions contained in the said Order, NPPA fixes/ revises the prices of formulations containing any of the 74 scheduled bulk drugs. The pricey are fixed/revised as per paragraph 7 of DPCO, 1995. In the case of imported scheduled formulations, the landed cost forms the basis of fixing its price along with such margin to cover selling and distribution expenses including interest and importer`s profit which shall not exceed fifty per cent of the landed cost. For the purpose of this provision, `landed cost` means the cost of import of formulation inclusive of customs duty and clearing charges. There were some reports in the newspapers in the recent past regarding promotional expenses being made by the Pharma Companies. The reports suggest that some unethical marketing practices are being followed by certain pharma companies. Keeping in view the seriousness of the allegations made in the medical reports, this Department felt the need to take up the matter in the interest of the consumers/patients as such promotional expenses being extended to doctors had direct implications on the pricing of drugs and its affordability. After discussing the issues with the Pharma Associations/Industry, this Department has been able to persuade most of the associations to have Code of ethics. Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) and Indian Drug Manufacturers` Association (IDMA) have informed that they along with Confederation of Indian Pharmaceutical (CIPI), Federation Pharmaceutical Enterpreneurs (FOPE), Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and SME Pharma Industries Confederation (SPIC) have worked out the `Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices` (UCMP). However, in a news article appearing in The Economic Times, Delhi dated 11.12.2009, it has been reported that a Senior Vice-chairman, SPIC has stated that they do not agree with the draft proposal. This Department has written to IDMA and OPPI to clarify the above statement. No one can sell any scheduled drugs/formulations at a price higher than that fixed by NPPA/Govt. Prices are fixed as per paragraph 7 of DPCO, 1995. The prices of non-scheduled imported finished formulations are not fixed by NPPA. NPPA, however, monitors the price movement of non-scheduled formulations. The monthly reports of ORG IMS and the information furnished by individual manufacturers are utilized for the purpose of monitoring prices of non-scheduled formulations. Whenever a price increase beyond 10% per annum is noticed, the manufacturer is asked to bring down the price voluntarily failing which, subject to prescribed conditions, action is initiated under paragraph 10(b) of the DPCO, 1995 for fixing the price of the formulation in public interest.\n",

Prices have risen on account of various factors like poor rainfall, high international prices, rising demand etc. In commodities like pulses and edible oils, imports take place every year because domestic production is not sufficient; 15-20% of pulses and 40-45% of edible oils are imported to meet the domestic demand. In the case of rice, due to poor monsoon, kharif production is likely to be lower than the demand. Similarly in the case of sugar, production has fallen short of demand in 2008-09. In order to check hoarding and blackmarketing, the Government of India has taken the following steps:- (i) Powers have been vested with State Governments for taking action under the provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980. (ii) To enable the State Governments/UT Administrations to take effective action for undertaking de-hoarding operations under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, it was decided to enable State Governments to impose stockholding limits by keeping in abeyance some provisions of the Central Order dated 15.02.2002 in respect of pulses, edible oils, edible oilseeds, rice and paddy for the period upto 30.09.2010. The commodity wheat which had also been included in the above list has been removed w.e.f.01.04.2009.

The increase in prices of the rice and wheat can be attributed partly due to the increase in MSP. Domestic prices of pulses rose mainly on account of the supply- demand mismatch and hardening of international prices. The increase in price of salt was due to un seasonal and intermittent rains during the September/December 2008 in the salt producing areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan during manufacturing season. Weather, apart from seasonal factors, may have contributed to increase in prices of vegetables and fruits. Potato prices increased as during 2008-09 potato production was estimated to be less in the states of Bihar, West Bengal and M.P because of late blight disease and less water availability in M.P. Onion prices increased primarily on account of the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and the heavy rain in Maharashtra, which affected the kharif crop of onion and its supply to markets across the country.

      "THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (Prof. K.V. Thomas) (a) : Facts show that futures trading in essential commodities has not been responsible for the price rise in recent period. There is no future trading in Urad and Tur since January 2007 when it was suspended. But the prices of these commodities are showing sharp increase during 2008-09 and 2009-10. The year-on-year price increase (in terms of Wholesale Price Index) at the end of financial year 2008-09 (29.3.2009) was 14.7% for Urad and 17.1% for Tur. During the year 2009-10 (as on 28.11.09) Y-o-Y increase was 59.46% and 72.25% for Urad and Tur respectively. As against this there is futures trading in Gram. Year on Year change of Prices of Gram was negative at -6.8% in 2008-09 and 4.32% during 2009-10 (as on 28.11.09) respectively. Therefore, the increase in prices of commodities need not necessarily be attributed to future trading. In fact an Expert Committee appointed by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of Planning Commission�<U+0080><U+0099>s Member Prof. Abhijit Sen to examine whether futures markets was responsible for rise in the prices of essential commodities in its report submitted in April 2008 did not find futures market responsible for the increase of the prices of essential commodities. The forward trading in a commodity is a mechanism for price discovery and price risk management and not a mechanism to check price rise. The futures market gives price signals for future periods of time based on the most likely supply and demand situation at those points of time. The market is tightly regulated. There are various effective tools like margins, price band, open interests limit etc. which the Regulator (Forward Market Commission) employs to regulate futures trading. (b) : The total value of trade during period three months of April to June 2009 was Rs.15, 64,114.96. The value of trade during the corresponding period of April-June 2008 was Rs.11,15,326.99 and that of the corresponding period of April-June 2007 was Rs.8,97,816.52. Figures for the month of June 2009, June 2008 and June 2007 were Rs. 5,77,056.718 crores, Rs. 4,13,551.34 crores and Rs. 2,82,550.35 crores respectively.

(b): The details of companies who have violated the ECB guidelines and penalties imposed by RBI thereto are given below. 1) Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (RIL) (formerly Reliance Energy Ltd) End-use violations have been observed by RBI in the ECBs raised by RIL pertaining to two ECBs for USD 360 million and USD 150 million. The company brought the proceeds raised through the said ECBs to India and kept these invested in debt mutual funds, pending utilization for the declared end-use in gross violation of the extant ECB guidelines. On an application filed by the company for compounding the end-use violations relating to the ECB of USD 360 million, a compounding order was passed in terms of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 and a penalty of Rs. 124.68 crore was levied. Since RIL did not pay the penalty in accordance with the Rules and the Provisions of FEMA, the violations were referred to the Directorate of Enforcement (DoE) in November 2008 for adjudication. 2) Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) RNRL issued FCCB of USD 300 million in October 2006 for the purpose of �<U+0080><U+0098>project�<U+0080><U+0099> under the automatic route. USD 275 million (Rs 1127 crore) were brought to India in May 2007 and were parked in debt mutual funds pending utilization. Subsequently, in Aug 2008, an amount of Rs.1160 crore (USD 275 million) was invested in a wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore. Since the alleged transactions have cross-border angle and since the Reserve Bank does not have the privileges of investigation, the issue has been referred to the DoE for undertaking investigation in the matter. 3) Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) A study of the audited report for the year March 2007 revealed that the unutilized money of Rs. 5,142 crore raised through issue of various FCCBs by the company has been deposited interest free with a wholly owned subsidiary which in turn has held the same in bank deposits. After ascertaining the facts, RCom was advised in August 2009 to apply for compounding under FEMA 1999. The company in their response has stated that the proceeds of the FCCBs were utilized for permitted end-use (telecommunication capital expenditure) taking into account the business exigencies and denied any contravention of the Regulation / Direction under FEMA. The reply is being examined for taking further action. (c): Two companies belonging to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) namely Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd (RPSCL) and Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd (VIPL) have approached the Reserve Bank of India under the approval route for raising ECB of USD 550 million each towards Import & local sourcing of capital goods for implementing power projects.

Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) recommended the DCRF over the period 2005-10. The Scheme has two components - (i) consolidation of central loans (from Ministry of Finance) contracted till 31.3.2004 and outstanding as on 31.3.2005, and (ii) provision of interest relief and grant of debt waiver to States based on their fiscal performance. Consolidation of central loans has given interest relief to States. Debt waiver is granted to States based on their fiscal performance, for which an assessment is made annually. Benefits under DCRF helped States by easing debt and interest pressures, and also incentivised States to follow the path of fiscal correction. This has facilitated the states to focus investment on development. Higher borrowings on account of relaxation of fiscal deficit target for 2009-10 will enable states to commit funds for capital expenditure, which will help in accelerating the growth revival in the medium term.\n",
